# newRecipeApp
Recipe based CRUD app.
 Features:
    Session-based login system,search and dropdown menu based recipe filters,CRUD capabilities for recipes.
    
 Lacks:
    Apart from separate pages for members and non-members there is no way to prevent users from editing(and deleting) each other's recipes.Also is severely lacking in the UI department.Total lack of security(the backend is my own handwritten PHP code).
    
    
 This project will not be maintained:I am currently working on an improved version of this project(kind of like this is an improvement on my recipeCollection repository)that will have a RESTful JSON backend and will be created with the help of a mature backend framework.
